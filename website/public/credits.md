Saika's UI is inspired by these websites:

- [**Docute**](https://docute.org)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
- [ZEIT Docs](https://zeit.co/docs)

Saika is a free and open-source project which is built upon many other open-source projects, such as:

<ul>
  <li v-for="dep in deps" :key="dep">{{ dep }}</li>
</ul>
