## Documentation site

We provide a plugin that saika can be to a documentation site.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@saika/theme-docs/dist/index.css">

<!-- Load this plugin after saika.js -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@saika/theme-docs"></script>
```

Then your site will become like me.
